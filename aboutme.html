    <h2>Introduction.</h2>
    <p>My name is Brian Meder. I am a computer science major at the University of Scranton. My interests in computing are web development, 
        cybersecurity, and game design. I started coding 3 years ago and have since built skills in Java, C, Assembly, HTML, CSS, Javascript,
        the Bootstrap framework, and APIs. I am soon to be inducted into the Pennsylvania Gamma Chapter of Upsilon Pi Epsilon, The International Honor Society
        for the Computing and Information Disciplines, an honor in which I was nominated by the computing sciences faculty at my university.
        Outside of computing, I enjoy music and play several instruments. 
    </p>
    <h2>About this webpage</h2>
    <p>I have coded this entire portfolio website myself, with the help of Youtube and the Global Tech Experience summer web development course. Something 
        I am working towards for this site is getting the page resizing completed for phones and tablets. One of my favorite additions to
        this site so far is the dynamic user greetings depending on the user's local time. At the top of this page you should be able to see this in action.
    </p>
    <h2>About my projects</h2>
    <p>With the opensource weather API <a href="https://openweathermap.org/"style="font-weight:bold">OpenWeatherMap</a> and the help of the internet, I was able to build my weather app. My horror themed matching
        game was my final project during my summer web development course. I hope that you enjoy playing with these apps.
    </p>
    <h2>What I am working on</h2>
    <p>Currently I am working on adding a chatroom app to this website using socket programming in Javascript. I also am brainstorming for my computer science
       senior capstone project at the University of Scranton for Spring 2025.
